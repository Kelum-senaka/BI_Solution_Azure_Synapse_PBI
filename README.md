# BI Solution using Azure synapse and Power BI

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world.

In this project,I used Azure Synapse Anlytics service for data ingestion,data transformation and data reporting task.Data ingestion and data transformation were done through synapse notebook insted of azure synapse pipeline.

I am extracting audio features for some specific tracks through spotify API.
